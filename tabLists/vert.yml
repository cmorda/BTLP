# This the default TabList
# It is shown to all users which haven't got another TabList
# 
# Create a copy of this File, name it like you wish
# and change the showTo and some other options
# to create another TabList only shown to some users.
# By doing this you can for example create
# a special TabList for VIPs / Admins or
# create a tabList only shown o one server
# You can find more information on the wiki https://github.com/CodeCrafter47/BungeeTabListPlus/wiki
